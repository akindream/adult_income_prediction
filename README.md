# adult_income_prediction
I used supervised learning methods to train the models on the labeled dataset to predict an 
individual's income level (binary discrete classification) as either above or below the given income threshold of 
$50,000 (fifty thousand US dollars). To find the best, most accurate and most resilient model for income prediction, 
I employed various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, KNN, SVM, GNB and 
several boosting measures. Several techniques were used for the data preparation such as class categorical data encoding, feature selection 
techniques and extraction. These were done using algorithms that were written using the Python programming language and machine learning packages, 
and prediction of results and performances were measured, gathered and visualized for comparison and decision making.
